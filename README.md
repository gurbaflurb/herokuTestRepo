# TravelMode

Vacations are hard, you always have a lot of information, in a lot of places. Itinerary, flight numbers, hotel reservations, confirmation codes, car reservations, it’s a mess. TravelMode lets you keep all of it in one place. Simply add a vacation, and fill in your travel info (reservations, todo list, etc.), save the vacation and you’re good to go!

## Setup
